# Pinfo

Pinfo is user-friendly, console-based viewer for Info documents.
Hope you like it :)

Until version 0.6.8, Pinfo was maintained by Przemek Borys. His old project
page is still available at [http://pinfo.sourceforge.net/](http://pinfo.sourceforge.net/). Unfortunately, Przemek is no longer active,
and development was taken over by Bas Zoetekouw and moved to Alioth:
[https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pinfo/](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pinfo/).
Since 2014 (version 0.6.10), development has moved to Github:
[https://github.com/baszoetekouw/pinfo](https://github.com/baszoetekouw/pinfo)

See man page (pinfo.1) for details.
